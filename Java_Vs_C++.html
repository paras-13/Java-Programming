    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>JAVA Vs C++</u></h2>
    <p style="font-size:22px;"><strong><em>Java and C++ are both programming languages, and while they share some similarities, there are
                significant differences
                in their code execution models.
                <br><br>Here are some key distinctions:</em></strong></p>
    <article style="font-size:18px;">

        <ol>
            <li> <b>Compilation:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                        Java source code is <u>compiled into an intermediate form called bytecode</u> by the Java
                        compiler
                        (javac).
                        <mark>bytecode is platform-independent</mark> and can be executed on any system that has a Java
                        Virtual
                        Machine (JVM) installed.
                    </li> <br>
                    <li>

                        C++ code is typically <u>compiled directly into machine code</u> or native code specific to the
                        target
                        platform.
                        <mark>The resulting executable file is platform-dependent.</mark>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Platform Independence:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Java is designed to be platform-independent, following the <mark><q>write once, run
                                anywhere</q></mark> principle.
                        The bytecode is executed by the JVM, which abstracts the underlying hardware and operating
                        system.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        C++ code needs to be recompiled for each target platform, and the resulting executable is
                        specific
                        to that platform.
                        Platform independence is not a built-in feature of C++, and separate binaries are required for
                        different systems.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Memory Management:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <mark>Java uses automatic memory management through garbage collection.</mark> The JVM is
                        responsible for
                        managing memory and
                        reclaiming unused objects.
                        Developers do not have direct control over memory allocation and deallocation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        C++ allows manual memory management. <mark>Developers have control over memory allocation and
                            deallocation</mark>
                        using operations
                        like new and delete (or malloc and free in C).
                        The flexibility of manual memory management comes with the responsibility of avoiding memory
                        leaks
                        and managing memory
                        carefully.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Execution Model:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Java code is executed by the JVM, providing a layer of abstraction between the Java program and
                        the
                        underlying hardware.
                        The JVM interprets or compiles bytecode at runtime, using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to
                        improve
                        performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        C++ code is executed directly by the operating system on the target machine.
                        The code is compiled into machine code, and the resulting executable interacts more closely with
                        the
                        hardware.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Error Handling:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                        Java uses exception handling for error management, requiring developers to explicitly catch or
                        declare exceptions.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        C++ also supports exception handling, but it also allows for traditional error-handling
                        mechanisms
                        like return codes.
                    </li>
